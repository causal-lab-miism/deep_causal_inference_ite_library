### Requirements:
1. Python 3.9, 
2. Tensorflow 2.8, 
3. Tensorflow Probability 0.16.0, 
4. Numpy

To run the code simply use:
```
python main.py --dataset_name [dataset name] --model_name [model name]
```
Alternatively use Jupyter notebooks.  

See the full list of available models and datasets in main.py.  

The file hyperparameters.py contains hyperparameters such as batch size or learning rate for the presented models.  

Note, that our code performs hyperparameter search at first execution for each method to find the other hyperparameters.

We output PEHE for each sub dataset and after training on all datasets an average PEHE with 95% confidence interval.
